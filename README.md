## Project Overview

This project uses a CNN model built with TensorFlow and Keras to classify images as either "cat" or "dog." The model was trained on a relatively small dataset as an introductory exercise in computer vision and deep learning.

## Dataset

The dataset used is the popular [Dogs vs. Cats dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats). The dataset can be downloaded directly using the Kaggle API. Below are the steps to download and prepare the dataset:

1. **Download the dataset from Kaggle**:
   ```python
   !kaggle datasets download -d salader/dogs-vs-cats

1. **Unzip the downloaded files**:
   ```python
   import zipfile
    zip_ref = zipfile.ZipFile('/content/dogs-vs-cats.zip', 'r')
    zip_ref.extractall('/content')
    zip_ref.close()
